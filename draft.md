1. Literature: what are n-grams, who used them
 - assumption-free
 - curse of dimensionality
2. Methods:
 - QuiPT (Fisher exact test, indefinitely faster, multiple criterions)
 - mention usage of the bit library for maximum computational speed
 - slam package for sparse encoding of data, work with even very large data sets dealing with RAM constraints
 - multiple criterions
3. Results (what?)

How to evaluate QuiPT?  
1. Compute how drastic must be the difference of fractions in both groups.  
2. Simulation study (motif length, sequence lenth, alphabet length) - sensitivity.
