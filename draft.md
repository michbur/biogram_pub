1. Literature: what are n-grams, who used them
 - assumption-free
 - curse of dimensionality
 - reduction of alphabets
2. Methods:
 - QuiPT (Fisher exact test, indefinitely faster, multiple criterions)
 - normalized encoding distance (heuristic to find the best reduced alphabets)
3. Results (what?)

How to evaluate QuiPT?  
1. Compute how drastic must be the difference of fractions in both groups.  
2. Simulation study (motif length, sequence lenth, alphabet length) - sensitivity.
